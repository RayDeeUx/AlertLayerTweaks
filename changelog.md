# AlertLayerTweaks Changelog
## 1.0.2
- Change text scale limit to 1.0 because too many people were abusing it to the point that it broke the BetterInfo changelog popup.
  - Try bypassing it if you want more regrets in your life.
- Force modified alerts to stay within 300 Cocos units tall.
## 1.0.1
- Port to 2.2074.
## 1.0.0
- Initial release (on GitHub). Changes from ErysEdits:
  - Add option to toggle an `FLAlertLayer`'s bouncing transition. (This setting is ignored if "Fast Menu" is enabled.)
- Big thanks to CatXus, Aktimoose, ninXout, and hiimjustin000 for helping out with testing!
